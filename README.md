word-o-mat
==========

Urgently need words that contain "q" but not "u"? Or words that use an "a", a "g", at least one ascender, and one diagonal, but no "x"? This is the sort of thing that word-o-mat can help you with. It's an extension for RoboFont that generates words for use in type sketching, spacing, testing etc.

This is my first RF extension, supplied without any promises and all that jazz. If you find any bugs or have suggestions for future development, please either fix them or send me a line, thx :)
