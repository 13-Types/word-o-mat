<h1>word-o-mat v1.2</h1>

<p>(Dec 10, 2013)</p>
<p>word-o-mat is an extension for RoboFont that generates words for use in type sketching, spacing, testing etc. This is my first RF extension, supplied without any promises and all that jazz. If you find any bugs or have suggestions for future development, please either fix them or <a href="mailto:altairas_eye@mac.com">send me a line</a>, thx :)</p>

<h2>Interface Elements</h2> 

<p><strong>Word Count</strong></p>
<p>The first row lets you specify the amount of words that should be generated. (If you&rsquo;re using these in the Space Center, it&rsquo;s better not to use extremely large numbers of words.)</p>

<p><strong>Word Length</strong></p>
<p>Adjust minimal and maximal length of created words. Both these numbers are inclusive (i.e. specifying 3 and 5 will yield three, four and five letter words).<br />
</p>

<p><strong>Case</strong></p>
<p>Select whether you want to look at words as they are provided, or converted to all lowercase, all uppercase, or with their first letter capitalized.<br />
</p>

<p><strong>Source</strong></p>
<p>Select where the words come from. By default, word-o-mat uses a text file included with the extension, a freely available and quite large crossword solvers&rsquo; word list called the UKACD (<a href="http://www.crosswordman.com/wordlist.html">UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary</a>). You can also use your Mac&rsquo;s internal dictionary, which is not as big but faster. As a third option, you can specify an own word list to use. This has to be a .txt file with the words on separate lines, and the script will disregard any lines that include spaces, since it looks strictly for words. (This is very new and sort of in beta; please let me know if you run into problems. Also, please don&rsquo;t blame me if any of the lists contain inappropriate words.)<br />
</p>

<p><strong>Obligatory characters</strong></p>
<p>Enter characters that must be contained in all returned words (a&ndash;z, A&ndash;Z; comma- or space-delimited list).</p>

<p><strong>Groups</strong></p>
<p>You can define up to three groups or sets of characters, and word-o-mat will look for words that contain at least one character from each of the specified groups. You can choose from presets (letters with ascenders, descenders, arches, diagonals, and ball-and-stick letters) or just type in your own (a&ndash;z, A&ndash;Z; comma- or space-delimited list).</p>

<p><strong>Banned characters</strong></p>
<p>Enter characters that must not be contained in the returned words (a&ndash;z, A&ndash;Z; comma- or space-delimited list).</p>

<p><strong>Limit to characters available in current font</strong></p>
<p>If you want to use word-o-mat for testing your existing font, you may want to tick this box to make word-o-mat exclude any words using letters you don&rsquo;t have (yet). (Obviously, this option is only available if you have a font open.) Deselect this option to generate words using the entire character set, for instance for sketching.</p>

<p><strong>No repeating characters</strong></p>
<p>Excludes words in which one or more characters occur more than once. Might be useful when generating words for sketching, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Randomize output</strong></p>
<p>Gives a random list of words every time the script is run. If this is unchecked, word-o-mat will simply return the first words it finds in the word list (see below).</p>

<h2>MEQ (Most Expected Questions)</h2>

<p><strong>Can I use word-o-mat for other languages?</strong></p>
<p>There are two things to consider. One is the word list that word-o-mat uses to find words. This can be replaced, see above, so you are free to use a list using words in a language other than English. The other consideration however is that word-o-mat does not yet support specifying characters outside the basic a&ndash;z/A&ndash;Z range as search criteria. This may be fixed in future versions if there is interest.</p>

<p><strong>word-o-mat makes my RoboFont reeeeally slow.</strong></p>
<p>Are you outputting hundreds of words into your Space Center? Maybe try a few less.</p>
